# Pyransom_PUBLIC_NO_SOURCE_CODE
This is a public repo of my personal project, Pyransom.
Pyransom is a proof of concept ransomware, built in python.

This repo does NOT have any source code. This public repo was made only to 
show what was the objective behind the project and to provide proof of concept GIFs

GITHUB REPO WITH SOURCE CODE IS ONLY AVAILABE TO RECRUITERS/INTERVIEWER UPON REQUEST. THIS IS DUE TO ETHICAL REASON.
I will NOT publicly post potentially dangerous codes, EVER.

# Objective 
 - Understand how ransomwares behave, and to defend against one 
 - Learn implementation of hybrid cryptosystem; AES for files, RSA for AES key encrypting 
 - Learn more about programming 
    - As a sophomore in University, I wanted to make something more than 
    moving turtles or solving tic-tac-toe puzzle.
 
 - (In-Progress) Perform Incident Response against ransomware

 - (In-Progress) Write a professional malware analysis/incident response report against pyransom
